# Solar-Power-Generation-System-for-Home-Using-MATLAB-Simulink
A Complete Solar PV Power Conversion and Home Supply System
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a complete Solar Photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion system modeled and simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. The system demonstrates how solar energy is converted into usable AC power for residential applications through power electronics and electromagnetic field (EMF) concepts.

The model includes:

PV Array

DC–DC Boost Converter

PWM Switching

IGBT/Diode Power Stage

Universal Bridge Inverter

LC Filter

Home/Load Connection

Voltage & Current Measurement

This project is suitable for Electrical Engineering, especially EMF, Power Electronics, Renewable Energy, and Simulation courses.

⚡ Features of the System

Simulation of a complete solar energy system

Boost converter for voltage regulation

Inverter for DC-to-AC conversion

LC filtering to generate clean sinusoidal AC

Variable irradiance & temperature analysis

Efficient power flow measurement

EMF concepts integrated inside inductors, capacitors, and switching devices

🧠 Importance in Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)

This project is strongly connected to EMF because:

PV cells use electromagnetic radiation (sunlight) to generate electricity.

Inductors store magnetic field energy (½LI²).

Capacitors store electric field energy (½CV²).

Switching devices (IGBTs, diodes) produce high-frequency electromagnetic transients.

AC waveform generation in the inverter is directly based on alternating electric & magnetic fields.

Thus, the project links real-world renewable energy with core EMF concepts.
